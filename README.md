- **PIN Change**: Users can change their PIN for enhanced security.
- **Transaction History**: Users can view their transaction history.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage user accounts, including adding and deleting users.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for building the application.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: For connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.
- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **MySQL**: Backend database to store user data, transaction records, and account information.
